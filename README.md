# OIBSIP

ðŸŽ‰ I have been selected for a remote Data Science Internship with Oasis Infobyte! <br>
ðŸ’» While internships in the Data Science field can be competitive, this opportunity allows me to gain experience in a virtual environment 
and get a better understanding of the industry. 

As an intern, I have been tasked with completing 3 out of 5 Data Science projects. This is a challenging yet exciting opportunity for me to test my knowledge and skills in the field of Machine Learning. Working with tools like Python and its libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn will not only allow me to apply what I have learned but also expand my expertise in this rapidly growing field. I am eager to take on these projects and see my progress as a Data Analyst.
